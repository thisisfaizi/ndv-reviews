# RR-20: Per-category rating criteria

Status: prd-ok (rev 3) · Plan: F (data layer, resolution, hooks) + P (the "Show for" UI) · Inherits PRD-00 + RR-00 · **Schema `Installer::V_CRITERIA_SCOPE`** (planned v8; provisional per PRD-00 §4, the number is taken at merge) · Raises `NDVR_API` to **10** (RR-00 F3b; planned build order, final at merge)

Round 2: passed; rev 3 only updates references to the shared rules (version constant, `NDVR_API` level).

## 1. Problem and who it's for
"Fit" makes sense for shoes, not for coffee. Multi-category stores either drop useful criteria or ask irrelevant ones. YITH's review boxes let criteria differ by category. Our `ndvr_criteria` table already has `scope`/`scope_id` columns (Installer.php:65-75), and `CriteriaRepository::get_active( $product_id )` has an unused parameter marked "future use" (CriteriaRepository.php:39-60).

## 2. Scope / non-goals
In scope:
- **Free data layer:** a criterion is either global or scoped to a set of product categories. For a product, the active criteria are:
  - all active global criteria, then
  - active criteria scoped to any of the product's categories, **including ancestors**,
  - each group by position, capped at the active cap per product.
- **Whose categories:** the categories of the review pool (`Pool::resolve_id()`), the post the review is stored on. Variations use their parent's categories; a Pro group pool uses the group parent's. The form, validation and summary all use the same id, so they always agree.
- **Back-compat rule:** `get_active()` with no id (or 0) still returns **all** active criteria, as today. Every caller that knows the product passes it.
- **Safety rule:** at least one **global** active criterion must always exist, so every product has a rating field.
- Free admin UI is unchanged apart from two hook points. Everything stays global until Pro (or code) scopes a criterion.
- **Pro:** a "Show for" control per criterion: "All products" or chosen categories (paired Pro task).

Non-goals: per-product scoping; per-tag scoping; different criteria for imports; hiding historic scores already stored on reviews.

## 3. User experience
- **Free:** no visible change. Rating Criteria (`ndv-reviews-criteria`) keeps add, toggle and delete (CriteriaPage.php:79-108). It gains a small "Shows for: All products" or "Shows for: Shoes, Boots" text per row, so scoped criteria (from Pro or code) are visible to free admins.
- **Pro, per row:** a "Show for" button opens a small form: radio "All products" / "Only these categories" + a category checklist + "Save".
  - Refusal notice: "At least one criterion must show for all products, so every product has a star rating."
- **Storefront:** on a coffee product, the form shows Quality and Value. On a shoe product it shows Quality, Value and Fit. The summary bars follow the same rule (§5).

## 4. Reuse map
- `Reviews\CriteriaRepository`: `get_active()`, `count_active()`, `is_last_active()` (:265-267), `insert()`/`update()`.
- `Reviews\Criteria::from_row()` (Criteria.php:72-86): gains `scope_ids`.
- `Reviews\Pool::resolve_id()`; `wc_get_product_term_ids()` and `get_ancestors()` for categories.
- `ReviewRepository::valid_scores()` (ReviewRepository.php:240-259).
- `Display\Summary::criteria_averages()` (Summary.php, the `criteria_averages` method, reading stored scores for the pool).
- `Admin\CriteriaPage::handle_actions()` / `render()`.
- F3 `Installer::is_current()`.

## 5. Blast radius
Free callers that must pass the product (pool) id:

| Caller | Today | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `ReviewForm::render_fields()` | `get_active()` (ReviewForm.php:245) | `get_active( Pool::resolve_id( get_the_ID() ) )` |
| `ReviewForm::handle_submit()` | `valid_scores( $raw )` (:399) | `valid_scores( $raw, $product_id )` |
| `TestimonialForm::render()` | `get_active()` (TestimonialForm.php:162) | `get_active( Pool::resolve_id( $product_id ) )` |
| `TestimonialForm::handle_submit()` | `valid_scores( $raw )` (:257) | with `$product_id` |
| `Landing::maybe_render()` | one `criteria` list for all products (Landing.php:154) | adds `criteria_by_product` (pid => Criteria[]); keeps `criteria` (all active) for old overrides |
| `Landing::handle_submit()` | `valid_scores( $raw_scores )` (:260) | with `$product_id` |
| `ReviewRepository::create()` | `valid_scores( … )` (ReviewRepository.php:116) | with `$product_id` |
| `Importers\Csv` | `get_active()` once (Csv.php:96) | per row: `get_active( Pool::resolve_id( $product_id ) )`; the CSV rating fills only that product's criteria |
| `templates/magic-landing.php` | loops `$criteria` (:72-87) | loops `$criteria_by_product[ $ndvr_pid ] ?? $criteria` |
| `Display\Summary::criteria_averages()` | all stored scores | drops rows for **scoped** criteria that don't apply to the pool; globals unchanged (active or not, as today) |

- **Unchanged:**
  - `Moderation\Page::valid_scores()` keeps `get_all()` (Page.php:309-325), so admins can edit any stored score;
  - `$ratings->recalc_review()` averages a review's own stored scores;
  - the review card shows a review's own stored scores.
- **Theme override** of `magic-landing.php` that loops `$criteria`: shows every active criterion. Submission drops the scores that don't apply. A shopper who rated only a non-applicable criterion gets "Please give a star rating…", the existing message.

Pro (paired tasks, Pro never edited by free):
- **Pro task RR-20P-1 (UI):** the "Show for" form through `ndv-reviews/criteria_row_after` and `ndv-reviews/criteria_handle_action`, saving through `CriteriaRepository::set_scope()`.
- **Pro task RR-20P-2:** `Admin\ManualReviews` builds its criteria list with `get_active()` (ManualReviews.php:265) and inserts directly (bypasses `create()`). Pass the chosen product's pool id so manual reviews offer the right criteria.
- **Pro task RR-20P-3:** `Importers\ProImporter` reads `get_active()` (ProImporter.php:519). Pass the row's product pool id before mapping scores.
- **Pro task RR-20P-4:** `Criteria\UnlimitedCriteria` raises `max_criteria` (UnlimitedCriteria.php:34); no change, but the cap now applies per product, which is what Pro users expect. Note it in Pro docs.

## 6. Contract delta
- **Schema `Installer::V_CRITERIA_SCOPE`** (provisional v8): `ndvr_criteria.scope_ids text DEFAULT NULL` (comma-separated `product_cat` term ids). A scoped criterion has `scope = 'category'`, `scope_id = NULL`, `scope_ids = '12,15'`. The existing single `scope_id` column stays unused.
- **`CriteriaRepository::get_active( $product_id = null ): Criteria[]`:** null or 0 means all active (back-compat); an id means resolved as in §2.
- **`CriteriaRepository::applies_to( Criteria $c, int $product_id ): bool`.**
- **`CriteriaRepository::set_scope( int $id, int[] $term_ids ): true|WP_Error`:** empty means global. It refuses with `ndvr_criteria_last_global` when it would leave no active global criterion.
- **`is_last_active()`** becomes "the only active **global** criterion". Deactivating or deleting the last active global is refused with the existing message (CriteriaRepository.php:274-279). Deactivating a scoped criterion is always allowed.
- **`ReviewRepository::valid_scores( array $scores, int $product_id = 0 )`:** 0 means all active (back-compat). An id means only criteria that apply to its pool.
- **`Criteria` property** `scope_ids` (int[]).
- **Filter** `ndv-reviews/active_criteria` (Criteria[] `$criteria`, int `$product_id`), applied after resolution and before the cap.
- **Actions (free fires, Pro uses):**
  - `ndv-reviews/criteria_row_after` (Criteria `$criterion`) inside each row's actions cell on Rating Criteria (CriteriaPage.php render loop, next to the toggle and delete forms);
  - `ndv-reviews/criteria_handle_action` (string `$do`, int `$id`), fired by `handle_actions()` for any `ndvr_criteria_do` value it doesn't handle, **after** its existing capability and nonce checks (CriteriaPage.php:84-88);
  - `ndv-reviews/criteria_saved` (int `$id`, string `$change`: added|toggled|deleted|scoped).
- **`NDVR_API` 10** covers the Pro-facing API here: `criteria_row_after`, `criteria_handle_action`, `CriteriaRepository::set_scope()`, the `$product_id` argument of `get_active()` and `valid_scores()`, and the `scope_ids` property. Pro tasks RR-20P-1 to RR-20P-3 register only when `NDVR_API >= 10`.
- **Template variable** `$criteria_by_product` in `magic-landing.php`.

## 7. Storage and upgrade
- `Installer::schema()` adds the column; `NDVR_DB_VERSION` becomes `Installer::V_CRITERIA_SCOPE` (provisional v8 per PRD-00 §4). dbDelta adds it; existing rows get NULL, which means global.
- No step needed: all existing rows are `scope = 'global'`.
- **Read guard:** scope resolution runs only when `Installer::is_current( Installer::V_CRITERIA_SCOPE )`. Before that, `get_active( $id )` behaves as `get_active()`, today's behaviour, and never reads the missing column.
- Category resolution: `wc_get_product_term_ids( $pool_id, 'product_cat' )` plus `get_ancestors( $term, 'product_cat', 'taxonomy' )`, cached in a static per request.

## 8. Security
- No new public entry point. Front-end resolution is read-only.
- `set_scope()` (Pro form via `criteria_handle_action`): free has already run `check_admin_referer( CriteriaPage::NONCE )` and `current_user_can( Caps::manage( 'criteria' ) )` before firing the action. Term ids are `absint`'d and each must exist in `product_cat` (`term_exists( $id, 'product_cat' )`), otherwise dropped. Stored with `$wpdb->update` and formats.
- The "Shows for" row text is `esc_html`'d term names.

## 9. Privacy
No personal data. Category scopes are store configuration. No readme change.

## 10. Performance and assets
- `get_active( $id )` is one cached criteria read (as today), plus the product's term ids and their ancestors, cached in a static. That's a few lookups per product page, and the term cache is primed on product pages.
- The landing page with N products resolves N times from the same cached criteria rows.
- No assets.

## 11. Compatibility
- Product categories only (`product_cat`). Non-product reviewable post types (`reviewable_post_types`) have no `product_cat` terms, so they get global criteria only.
- HPOS: not involved.
- PHP 7.4, WP 6.0, WC 8.0 (`wc_get_product_term_ids` exists).
- Theme overrides: §5.
- Pro absent: no criterion can be scoped through the UI, so behaviour is identical. Pro present: §5 tasks.

## 12. Acceptance criteria
1. Upgrade from `Installer::V_CRITERIA_SCOPE - 1` adds `scope_ids` and sets the version to `Installer::V_CRITERIA_SCOPE`. With the version option forced to `Installer::V_CRITERIA_SCOPE - 1`, `get_active( $shoe_id )` returns the same as `get_active()` and runs no query referencing `scope_ids`.
2. Free only (no scoped rows): the `.ndvr-criteria-group` markup of the rendered product form, testimonial form and landing page is identical before and after the change for a fixture product (snapshot compare, with nonce and unique-id values masked).
3. `get_active()` with no argument returns all active criteria, including scoped ones.
4. Scope "Fit" to Shoes through `set_scope()`: the shoe product form shows Quality, Value and Fit; the coffee product form shows Quality and Value.
5. A product in "Running", a child of Shoes, also gets Fit. A variation of a shoe product (pool = parent) gets Fit.
6. Submitting Quality 4 + Fit 5 on coffee through `ndvr_submit_review` saves a review with only Quality (Fit dropped), and its overall rating is 4. Submitting only Fit on coffee returns "Please give a star rating before submitting your review."
7. Landing page for an order with a shoe and a coffee: the shoe form contains Fit and the coffee form doesn't. Each submits correctly.
8. A theme override of `magic-landing.php` that loops `$criteria` still renders and submits (non-applicable scores dropped).
9. The summary on coffee doesn't show Fit even when a Fit score was inserted directly on a coffee review (simulated history). A global criterion that is now inactive still shows as before.
10. `set_scope()` on the only active global criterion returns `ndvr_criteria_last_global`. Deactivating it returns the last-active error. Deactivating scoped Fit succeeds.
11. CSV import of a coffee row fills only coffee's criteria. The review's overall equals the CSV rating.
12. `criteria_handle_action` fires only after the nonce and capability pass. A POST without the nonce doesn't fire it (action counter).
13. The `active_criteria` filter can remove a criterion for one product.
14. Core flows pass.

## 13. Test plan
Use the RR-11 §13 harness.
1. Create the categories Shoes > Running and Coffee, products in each, and a variable shoe.
2. Upgrade simulation (AC1).
3. Render snapshots before scoping (AC2, AC3), then call `set_scope()` and render the forms and landing (AC4, AC5, AC7, AC8).
4. AJAX submits (AC6); Summary render with a seeded score (AC9).
5. Repository calls (AC10, AC13), the CSV import (AC11), and a CriteriaPage POST (AC12).
6. Core flows.

## 14. Open questions
None.
