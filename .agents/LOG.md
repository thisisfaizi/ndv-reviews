# LOG.md — append-only iteration log

Newest entries at the bottom. One entry per loop iteration / handoff. Keep it evidence, not essays.

Format:
```
## <date> — <task id> — <who>
CHANGED: <files>
OBSERVED: <real output — flows run, Plugin Check, debug.log>
RESULT: pass | fail (+ next hypothesis)
```

## 2026-07 — bootstrap — @manager
CHANGED: AGENTS.md, claude.md (rebuilt into constraints doc), .agents/{TASKS,CONTRACTS,CONTEXT,LOG}.md,
.gitattributes (export-ignore the dev docs).
OBSERVED: multi-agent protocol adapted from the CPIU template to the NDV Reviews pair; public contract
surface extracted and verified by grepping both plugins; board seeded from shipped work (P1–P7 + S-01..S-05)
and the PRODUCTION-PLAN backlog.
RESULT: protocol established. NEXT (highest leverage): T-C1 (public AI endpoint) or T-B1 (rating-less
aggregate desync) — both are live-store risks.
