# Rosette Reviews — Feature List (Free vs Pro), as shipped in 1.0.0

This list describes what the code does today, verified in the 2026-10 release audit
(`.agents/AUDIT-2026-10.md`). Planned work is listed separately at the end and is not a claim.

**Positioning against ReviewX (2.5.x):** ReviewX requires a cloud account for every user (free included),
syncs store data to its servers, refuses localhost, and caps free reminder emails at 20/month. Rosette Reviews
runs entirely on the merchant's server: no account, no quota, no data leaves the site. ReviewX has no
product Q&A and no AI review summary.

- Anti-spam: honeypot + per-IP rate limit (skipped for signed links) + optional reCAPTCHA v3 (all forms).
- Import WooCommerce reviews and CSV (deduplicated, skip reasons reported); export CSV/JSON (all statuses,
  criteria, photos; formula-injection safe).
- GDPR export/erase covering reviews, photos, request log, tokens and the unsubscribe list.
- Opt-in uninstall cleanup that never deletes native WooCommerce reviews.

## PRO (Freemius)
- Unlimited criteria.
- Video reviews: oEmbed providers (no discovery) or direct .mp4/.webm; embed cached, never fetched per view.
- Store replies (with AI suggestion), highlight/pin, top-reviewer badge, anonymous reviews.
- Coupon reward: verified paid order containing the product, one coupon per order, single-use, expiring.
- Product Q&A: questions, answers (editable), votes, moderation with restore, QAPage schema (single question).
- AI with your own OpenAI or Anthropic key: summary (debounced, failure back-off), sentiment, spam score,
  tags, auto-publish of clearly positive pending reviews below the spam ceiling, reply suggestions,
  translation (language allowlist + daily budget). Imports never trigger AI calls.
- ESP connectors: Klaviyo, Mailchimp (transactional contacts), Brevo, webhook — async, respects unsubscribes.
- Automation: one delayed email step with smart rules; bulk campaign for past orders (deduplicated).
- External reviews: Google (API key / link-only aggregate), Facebook — deduplicated sync, no fake ratings,
  never marked verified, aggregates recalculated.
- Importer for Judge.me, Yotpo, ReviewX and generic CSV — BOM/header normalization, ID→SKU→handle→title
  matching, preview before import, skip reasons.

- Analytics: monthly volume/average, rating distribution, keywords, CSV export.
- REST API (read-only, public products only), signed webhooks with retries and delivery log, WP-CLI.
- Review Manager role (`ndvr_manage_reviews`) without WooCommerce settings access.
- Variation review pooling; verified-purchase gating; banned words (whole-word); auto-approve rules;
  low-rating alerts.

## Next release (built and tested, in the readmes under "Unreleased"; not in 1.0.0)
Free:
- Requests claimed before sending (no duplicates, 20 h per-order cooldown); request log with source, opened and
  reviewed times; conversion count on the dashboard; optional UTM tags and open tracking.
- Send a review request from an order (Order actions) or in bulk (up to 200); never twice within 20 hours.
- Exclusions: product categories (with children), single products, customer roles; applied to earlier links too.
- One follow-up reminder (own subject, text, preview), only to customers with something left to review.
- Checkout consent checkbox for review emails (classic + Checkout block, opt-in/opt-out), recorded with time and
  wording; every review email respects it.
- Multilingual: WPML (+ WCML) and Polylang; emails and the review page in the order's language; merchant texts
  translatable.
- "How reviews work" transparency notice (off by default), shortcode and block.
- Disclosure label on rewarded reviews; reviews from WordPress's own comment form always held for moderation.
- Privacy export/erase cover questions and answers and checkout consent answers.

Pro:
- Incentive disclosure on every Pro surface, REST, webhooks and the Google feed (schema 2.4); rating-independent
  coupon reward (on approval, or after 7 days unless rejected with a reason); reject with reason; dated
  backfill tool. AI "auto-publish clearly positive" removed; replaced by "publish pending reviews that pass the
  AI spam check, whatever their rating or tone".
- Importers: photos (hardened background download), store replies, video links, other-app verified label;
  Q&A CSV import/export.
- Automation on the shared pipeline: first email + up to two reminders, translatable (WPML/Polylang); switching
  off stops queued emails; skipped when the store already sent one. Bulk campaigns ask each customer once and
  skip anyone emailed in 30 days. ESP pushes use the shared gate (consent, roles, unsubscribes).
- List campaigns: CSV upload, preview with skip reasons, attestation and audit record, paced background sending.
